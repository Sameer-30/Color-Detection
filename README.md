# Color Detection 

## Overview
I've created this project to introduce users to computer vision using Python and OpenCV. It focuses on detecting yellow color in real-time video captured from a webcam. The project is designed to help beginners understand the basics of image processing and computer vision techniques.

## Features
- Real-time color detection using a webcam.
- Conversion of frames from BGR to HSV color space.
- Creation of a mask to isolate the yellow color.
- Generation of a bounding box around detected yellow regions.
- Interactive display of the processed frames with highlighted yellow regions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python pillow
3. Make sure you have a webcam connected to your computer.
